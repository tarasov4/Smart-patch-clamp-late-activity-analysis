# Smart-patch-clamp-late-activity-analysis

The program for processing of smart patch clamp signal.
The program performs:
  1. baseline correction with JBCD algorithm (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26688879/).
  2. processing of events search report from ClampFit.
  3. cluster analysis of shut periods in late channel activity with DBSCAN algorithm.
